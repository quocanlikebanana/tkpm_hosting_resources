    <!-- Title -->
    <h1>General Coding Standards</h1>


    <p style="margin-top: 2em;">
        These are general coding standards that requires everyone in the team to be known of.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Prefer to use shortened syntaxes.</li>
        <li>Spacing based on default foramtting options (e.g Prettier, Visual Studio built-in tools, ...).</li>
        <li>Use descriptive names (files, functions, variables, ...). Use abbreviations only for situations that are
            very common or have appeared before.</li>
        <li>Modular and meaningful folder structure.</li>
        <li>Modular and meaningful file content. Each class, module, or package should only belong to a file.</li>
        <li>Prefer understandable code than having to comment for others to understand it.</li>
        <li>Comments, if have to, explaining the "why" rather than the "what".</li>
        <li>Apply priciples (DRY, S.O.L.I.D, YAGNI, ...) as much as possible.</li>
        <li>Apply patterns when necessary.</li>
        <li>Avoid half-done commit on Git (use Amend option when commit). Each commit should have a meaningful message
            in its name.</li>
        <li>Avoid using <code>magic numbers</code>. Instead, use constants or enums.</li>
    </ul>
